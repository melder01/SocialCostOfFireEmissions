To run the model, download all pieces of code. No additional data files are required; all starting values are included in the 'sub_loadguesses' script. The 'GUI_DefineParams' script allows for easy alternations to important parameters, such as rho and eta which contribute to the discount rate, but it should not be necessary to run it manually. To run the program, simply run 'main_dice2016r' and the option to choose parameters should pop up.
